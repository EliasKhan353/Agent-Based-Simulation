# Agent based Simulation
 Covid Simulator
https://mittalc.github.io/Agent-Based-Simulation/

We aim to simulate the spread of Covid 19 using a simple covid simulation tool.
The tool can help facilitate more effective and faster-paced decision-making,
leading to positive impacts on the evolution of COVID-19. The analysis that we will
be getting, will show how much time can have a huge impact on the trajectory of
the disease. This is an open-sourcing toolset for researchers and data scientists to
better model and understand the progression of COVID-19 in a given community
over time.
